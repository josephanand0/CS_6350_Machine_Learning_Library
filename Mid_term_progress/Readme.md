This section is my progress(mid-term) of my final project.

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning solution to predict a residentâ€™s yearly income level is greater than $50,000 using features such as age, work class, education and working hours per week etc. The test and train dataset is given and I have to build a model that accurately predicts the income level greater than $50,000.



For running and executing all files you can see the commands in run.sh file that is in this directory.



This section has implementations for adaboost model, randomforest model and hist gradient model.
